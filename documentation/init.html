<h2><a id="init">Initialisation</a></h2>

<p>
  In order for SuperScript.Javascript's internal properties to be initialised for each HTTP request, an additional
  step must be taken: for each HTTP request the default declarations should be added.
</p>

<p class="italic">
  The default declarations are those which are declared in the config file or in the <code>SuperScriptConfig</code> class.
</p>

<p>
  Here is an example showing how these default declarations could be added.
</p>

<pre class="brush: c#">
  var defaultDecs = Configuration.Settings.Instance.Declarations;
  foreach (var declaration in defaultDecs)
  {
	  SuperScript.Declarations.AddDeclaration<Declarables.DeclarationBase>(declaration);
  }
</pre>

<p>
  There are two recommended locations for including this code, though <strong>these are only required if not installed via 
  NuGet</strong>, or if the NuGet-added configuration is removed.
</p>

<p>
  An HTTP handler with the above code is already included inside SuperScript.JavaScript. To enlist this 
  HTTP handler the following code should be added to the web.config file:
</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
  &lt;httpModules&gt;
    &lt;add name="HttpInitialiser" type="SuperScript.HttpInitialiser, SuperScript.JavaScript" /&gt;
  &lt;/httpModules&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  An alternative is to use the <code>Application_BeginRequest</code> event in the project's global.asax file.
</p>
